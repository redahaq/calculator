# Calculator

A vanilla javascript calculator, as part of the pre-course work for Founders and Coders.

## Issues

There appears to be some sort of DOM issue - I can see the nodelist length as 11 when I check the console for documents.getElementsbyClassName(.num), but when I tried to console.log this as a test in the javascript, it said it was 0. Same for other DOM elements. It took a while to figure this out. This was happening locally when using my text editor/ browser, and so I ended up having to throw all my code in codepen where it was displaying fine.

I'd also like to resolve the fact that you can enter more than one decimal point and also limit the number of digits displayed.
